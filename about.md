I make tech and computing videos on YouTube! This site is here to complement the videos I make, with additional information and other stuff that's too short to put into a video.

This site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the theme I'm using is a modified version of  [Mediumish](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll), made by **WowThemes.net**. [Mediumish](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) and [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme/blob/master/LICENSE), the syntax highlighting theme, is licensed under the MIT license.
