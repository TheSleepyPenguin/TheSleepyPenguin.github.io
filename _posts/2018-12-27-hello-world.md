I've set up a new site to explain extra information on existing videos and to show the progress of future ones. Additionally, I'll pop downloads here, just so that things are better. :)

The posts for existing videos will be dated as the video release date, hence why there are posts older than today.

This is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and this wonderful theme is made by **WowThemes.net**, with the Github repo found [here](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll).

The theme and syntax highlighting CSS is licensed under the MIT license, which can be found below.

Code test!

```python
for i in range(28):
    print("Hello World!")

def main(a, b):
    while True:
        a = 38
        b = "jkl"
        
```
