Here, we make Windows 10 look like Windows 7. This has been tested to work with Windows 10 1809 and below. This includes getting the Windows 7 theme, Start Menu, Taskbar and Aero Glass.

**Note:** The tools used in this video can break Windows, so please make a backup of your data and create a System Restore point before you begin. Also, before a major Windows update, it is recommended that you disable/uninstall all the tools temporarily used in this video to make sure that Windows updates smoothly. After the update, make sure that you do some research to ensure that the software will not cause major problems with your PC. This was recorded on the Windows 10 Creators Update released in Spring 2017 (1703).

I can not be held responsible for loss of data/data corruption or your PC breaking.

### Useful things to have

Before you begin, it is advised that you try this in a Virtual Machine/Spare PC first to make sure that there are no issues.

* **7Zip**: Unzip all sorts of archives!

* **Control Panel Personalisation**:
  * Useful if you're not using an activated copy of Windows for testing!
  * Pop this into the run box (`Win` + `R`) or CMD
  * `explorer.exe ::{26EE0668-A00A-44D7-9371-BEB064C98683}\0\::{ED834ED6-4B5A-4BFE-8F11-A626DCB6A921}`
* **Virtualbox**:
  * Test things in a virtual machine first, without affecting your real PC!
